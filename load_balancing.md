## Testing the configuration

### Testing the Virtual Service

*To test the functionality of the Virtual Service, use the same URL that was used to access the LoadMaster. This time the HTTP protocol will be used on port 80. Example: http://vlmhoeeei2eds2boe.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com*


1. Open your browser and navigate using the URL provided by your Test Drive.  The page below will be displayed in your browser.
![it worked](https://github.com/KEMPtechnologies/azure-test-drive/raw/master/images/itworked.png "it worked")


1. On the KEMP LoadMaster left hand navigation select Statistics and Real Time Statistics
![real time statistics](https://github.com/KEMPtechnologies/azure-test-drive/raw/master/images/rts.png "real time statistics")


1. Click through the Global, Real Servers, Virtual Services, Connections, Bytes, Bits, and Packets to see the statistical information provided by the KEMP LoadMaster.

### Next Steps

Hopefully this Azure Test Drive demonstrated how easy the KEMP LoadMaster is to setup and operate.  Additional features can be explored through our Free LoadMaster in the Azure Marketplace or one of our full featured offerings provided with either hourly or bring your own license (BYOL) options.
